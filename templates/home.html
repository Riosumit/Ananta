          There is a wide gap between patients who need transplants and the
          organs that are available in India. An estimated around 1.8 lakh
          persons suffer from renal failure every year, however the number of
          renal transplants done is around 6000 only. An estimated 2 lac
          patients die of liver failure or liver cancer annually in India, about
          10-15% of which can be saved with a timely liver transplant.
          <br /><br />
          Hence about 25-30 thousand liver transplants are needed annually in
          India but only about one thousand five hundred are being performed.
          Similarly about 50000 persons suffer from Heart failures annually but
          only about 10 to 15 heart transplants are performed every year in
          India. In case of Cornea, about 25000 transplants are done every year
          against a requirement of 1 lakh.

          There are also certain medical conditions that may prevent someone
          from donating organs, such as active cancer or certain infectious
          diseases. However, even if someone has a medical condition that
          prevents them from donating certain organs, they may still be able to
          donate other organs or tissues.
